shows an event happened very recently, and it has some importance now

8. I have fixed us some iced tea.
9. The family next door has moved out.
10. The express train has already left.

Sentence 8 shows the iced tea is ready to drink. Sentence 9 shows the house next door is empty now. And, sentence 10 shows the train is not here.
