forced-guidedとは何か?

> Mechanical guiding (forced guiding) makes it impossible to close the normally closed and normally open contact simultaneously. If a normally closed contact becomes welded, it must be impossible for the normally open contacts to close when the coil is energized.

NC接点とNO接点が同時にcloseすることがないようにする機構のようだ。
