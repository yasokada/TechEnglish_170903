When you want to express a more continuous state than the "continuative" usage of the present perfect, use the present perfect progressive.

1. I have been attending college for over one year.
2. You have been practicing piano since this morning.
3. We have been playing soccer all day today.
4. The wind has been blowing hard for hours.
